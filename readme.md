## ðŸ¦„ Shades of Purple Unofficial Port

This theme is an unffocial port of the [Shades of Purple(SOP) theme](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-vscode).
Due to the fundamental differences between Microsoft's Visual Studio Code and the Graviton, not all settings will be the exact same. 
If you have any suggestions or improvements, please open an issue.

## ðŸ•¹ Developing
This theme has been tested in Graviton v2.1.1

Clone the repo to the desired .graviton2/plugins:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/DJN1/Graviton-Shades-of-Purple
```
